## SMU CS202 Design And Analysis Of Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions for an intermediate course in data structures and algorithms. This course builds on studentsâ€™ earlier programming experiences, mathematical knowledge (discrete math and linear algebra), and knowledge of data structures, to the question of how to solve problems by designing algorithms for efficiency.  The materials as well as the assignments rely on proficiency with Python programming language. 

#### Course Outline :

- The different paradigms of algorithm design such as greedy, divide and conquer, and dynamic programming.

- Limits of algorithm design via a study of intractability including reductions of given problem to known problems. This includes knowledge of NP/co-NP. The approach will not be via the more rigorous Turing machine/Formal language approach as the students do not have that prerequisite knowledge.

- More modern algorithm design concept such as approximation to achieve more effective problem solving and more efficient solutions. 
This course will go into the theoretical underpinnings of efficiency, algorithm correctness, and how algorithm design has a basis in identifying mathematical properties of the problem.

## Final Project

The team explored different algorithms to tackle the Max-Flox problem. After doing some research, our team decided to go for Push-Relabel algorithms for this project and went ahead to implement the actual code.
